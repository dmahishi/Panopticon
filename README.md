# Panopticon
The Panopticon package allows affordable fly locomotion tracking. 
It consists of a: 
(1) 3D-printable .stl file that splits a petridish into 8 individual fly arenas, 
(2) FIJI-based macro to track the animals offline, and 
(3) MATLAB script bundle that provides repair, analysis and visualization tools for fly locomotion.
